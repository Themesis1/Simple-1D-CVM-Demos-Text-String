# Simple-1D-CVM-Demos-Text-String
Code and experiments for the 1D Cluster Variation Method (CVM), illustrated with text strings expressing the same meaning, in two languages (French and English). 

This GitHub repository contains both code for the 1D CVM as well as a worked example. The code (possibly in later installations) will also allow user interaction, facilitating further experiments. 

The data used for this 1D CVM worked example is included within the code. It is based on the text for the French song, "Je t'aime," and both French and English versions are used. The code can be used as-is, simply by copying it into any Python IDLE and running it, with no need for external directories. 

The code illustrates how we can find the CVM entropy for a 1D system, composed of a single zigzag chain. 

The Cluster Variation Method (CVM), invented by Ryoichi Kikuchi (1951) and expanded by Kikuchi and Brush (1967) is a means of approximating the free energy for a system via a more complex entropy expression. 

A brief document will be inserted into this directory with more background, as well as references.
